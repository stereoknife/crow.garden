			<h1>Now in The Crow Garden</h1>
			<p>Not much going on right now in right here in this garden, hella busy with uni (I fell for that trap a second time somehow) and work (they keep giving me 30h on my 15h contract send help please). But there are plans!! Here are plans:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Continue work for my tiny silly little renderer that I started last spring (this comes from uni assignments when the classes were cool)</li>
				<li>Get back into PICO-8 now that I know a lot more about rendering (it's crimes time)</li>
				<li>Get started on my HPCS math/geometry library (this is an idea I'm carrying over from my previous job as VR developer)</li>
				<li>Continue/restart/idk-it's-complicated work on Super Axolotls 2000 (a worms Armageddon inspired game :] )</li>
				<li>Add some actual content to this website and make it easier to work with (no more copying and pasting please)</li>
				<li>Start my blog (zine)!!! I wanna talk more about things I'm making but it's so hard to do but I will persevere.</li>
				<li>Make the site's style cool again</li>
				<li>Get a film scanner to properly re scan my film (so many lost to reformatting (sobbing))</li>
				<li>Normalize sharing scrappy fiddles</li>
				<li>Share scrappy fiddles</li>
				<li>Use even more parentheses</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Woah that's a lot of stuff, I'm probably not gonna be able to do most of them but that's ok.</p>
